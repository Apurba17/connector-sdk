   * being re-pushed unnecessarily. However, the cost of pushing unchanged items is low and doing
   * so heals any synchronization errors or cache inconsistencies that might exist in the system.
   *
   * <p>For flat or full traversal strategies, push {@link PushItem} instances for all items to be
   * indexed. For graph traversal strategies, push only the start node of each graph.
   *
   * <p>Alternatively, a {@link Connector} implementation can issue an {@link Index} for
   * each item in the repository instead of using {@link Push} and {@link Poll}. Such
   * implementations might be suitable for smaller repositories requiring only a periodic full sync.
   *
   * <p>This method may take a while and implementations may want to call {@link Thread#sleep}
   * occasionally to reduce load.
   *
   * <p>If fatal errors occur, throw an {@link IOException} or {@link RuntimeException}.
   * In the case of an error, the {@link com.google.enterprise.cloudsearch.sdk.ExceptionHandler}
   * defined in {@link IndexingConnectorContext} determines if and when to retry.
   *
   * @throws IOException if getting data access errors
   * @throws InterruptedException if an IO operations throws it
